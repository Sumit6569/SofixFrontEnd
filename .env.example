# Environment variables for the Frontend
# Use a production verify origin (domain) for generated QR verify links.
# Set this to https://sofixs.com for deployed production builds.
VITE_VERIFY_ORIGIN=https://sofixs.com

# Example: to test locally but still point to production verify use:
# VITE_VERIFY_ORIGIN=https://sofixs-website.onrender.com

# Leave unset to use the current origin (e.g., http://localhost:5173 during dev).
